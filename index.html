		<h2>We're getting married!</h2>
		Stuff about us blurb
		<h3>September 17th, 2017</h3>
		<h3>Grim's Dyke Hotel</h3>
		The ceremony and reception are taking place at the <a href="http://grimsdyke.com/">Grim's Dyke Hotel</a>* in Harrow. <br />We're reserving several hotel rooms for friends and family members. If you would like to book a room, you will receive a discounted rate if you tell them you're with the wedding party. <br /><br />
		*Fun fact: This is the former house of librettist W. S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan.
		<h3>Registry</h3>
		Our household is fairly complete and our apartment is small, so we aren't making an extensive wedding registry. If you would like to get us something, we will add a link to a small registry soon. We would also appreciate donations to go towards a honeymoon!
		<h3>Drop us a message</h3>
		We hope you can share this special day with us!
		<h3>Travel</h3>
		A <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-visa-idUSKBN1691Q9">new regulation</a> could possibly be going into effect that would require US citizens to apply for a visa when visiting the European Union. For current information please refer to the <a href='https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/united-kingdom.html'>US State Department website for international travel</a>.
